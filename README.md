# GSMWAM-IPE

The Whole Atmosphere Model - Ionosphere, Plasmasphere, Electrodynamics (WAM-IPE) is
a model that extends the NOAA operational atmospheric weather codes into the thermosphere
and plasmasphere to provide upper atmosphere physics forecasts.

## LibEnsemble edition!
This branch has additional scripts in /scripts/compsets to faciliate ensembles of forecasts. Please see the README in /scripts/compsets for details.
